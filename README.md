# Restaurant-Tracker
[Restaurant Tracker](https://fathomless-coast-46070.herokuapp.com/)

Create a list of restaurants you wish to visit, and then, after you've visited them, you can decide whether you liked or disliked them!

## Getting Started

Open up the [project link](https://fathomless-coast-46070.herokuapp.com/) and you should be able to see the webpage shown below:

![Restaurant Tracker](readme/readme.gif "Restaurant Tracker")

You can add new restaurants in the input field in the header. If you've visited one of the restaurants you can give it a `thumbs up` if you liked it or a `thumbs down` if you didn't. Once you've visited a restaurant, you can choose to remove it from the tracker if you're no longer interested in it.

Check out those restaurants you've always wanted to go to!

### Prerequisites

You need to have a modern browser able to handle html5, javascript, and css. 

### Installing

## Challenges
I dove into Handlebars and the MVC model with this project. Handlebars is very convenient for just serving up pages without having to write a lot of javascript or repeating html.

![Restaurant Tracker](readme/handlebars-partial.png "Restaurant Tracker")

I explored handlebar's built in conditionals and iterators in order to minimize repeated code. Partials have been incredibly useful for creating dynamic content relatively painlessly.

![Model View Controller](readme/mvc.png "Model View Controller")

I took a baby step towards using the MVC model last project, but I fully utilized the model this time. This was a great experience that will prepare me for working with larger projects.
