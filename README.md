# Restaurant-Tracker
[Restaurant Tracker](https://sequelize-restaurant.herokuapp.com/)

Create a list of restaurants you wish to visit, and then, after you've visited them, you can decide whether you liked or disliked them!

## Getting Started

Open up the [project link](https://sequelize-restaurant.herokuapp.com/) and you should be able to see the webpage shown below:

![Restaurant Tracker](readme/readme.gif "Restaurant Tracker")

You can add new restaurants in the input field in the header. If you've visited one of the restaurants you can give it a `thumbs up` if you liked it or a `thumbs down` if you didn't. Once you've visited a restaurant, you can choose to remove it from the tracker if you're no longer interested in it.

Check out those restaurants you've always wanted to go to!

### Prerequisites

You need to have a modern browser able to handle html5, javascript, and css. 

### Installing

No installation needed! Just open the page in your preferred browser.

## Built With

* Html

* CSS

* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The scripting language used

* [BootstrapCDN v4.1.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) - The web framework used

* [jQuery v3.3.1](http://jquery.com/) - Java library for DOM and CSS manipulation

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font repository

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime

* [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager for JavaScript and Node

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Server-side framework

* [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-table) - Request parsing middleware

* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) - Semantic templates for HTML generation

* [mySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) - Make server-side SQL queries

* [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) - ORM for SQL database

## Challenges
I ported my restaurant tracker over to Sequelize. Apparently, the custom ORM I'd made was very similar in syntax to sequelize, so there was minial fuss in the transfer. Learning to use Sequelize will make future interactions with SQL databases so much easier.
